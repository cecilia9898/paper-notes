## üñ•Ô∏è **x86 Family**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **x86_64**
- Also known as **AMD64** or **Intel 64**.
- A 64-bit architecture widely used in desktops, laptops, and servers.
- Supports up to **16 exabytes (EB)** of memory addressing.
- Optimized for high performance and multi-threaded applications.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **i686**
- A 32-bit version of the x86 architecture, often referred to as **IA-32**.
- Mostly found in older PCs and legacy applications.
- Maximum memory addressing of **4GB**.
- Outdated for modern computing, as most new software requires 64-bit.

## üì± **ARM Family**
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **aarch64**
- The 64-bit version of ARM, known as **ARMv8-A 64-bit**.
- Commonly found in **Raspberry Pi 4**, **Apple M1/M2/M3 chips**, and **mobile devices**.
- High energy efficiency and powerful performance.
- Well-suited for mobile and low-power computing.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **armv7l**
- A 32-bit ARM architecture, based on **ARMv7**.
- Used in **Raspberry Pi 2/3** and early **Android devices**.
- Optimized for low power consumption.
- Limited memory addressing and lower performance compared to `aarch64`.

## üñ•Ô∏è **PowerPC Family**
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **ppc64le**
- A 64-bit architecture under the **PowerPC** series, using **Little Endian** format.
- Commonly found in **IBM Power Systems**.
- Known for strong multi-threaded processing capabilities.
- Mainly used in high-performance computing and enterprise servers.

## üñ•Ô∏è **RISC-V Family**
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **riscv64**
- An open-source 64-bit architecture.
- Designed for **modular and customizable processors**.
- Growing in popularity for **research**, **IoT devices**, and **embedded systems**.
- Fully open standard, allowing free extensions and optimizations.
