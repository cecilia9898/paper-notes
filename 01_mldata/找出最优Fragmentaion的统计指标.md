# Proteomics Data Quality Metrics and Analysis Strategy

This document outlines a multi-level strategy for analyzing and evaluating proteomics data, focusing on fragment ions, scans, and peptides. The goal is to identify representative ions, assess data quality, and understand fragmentation patterns.

## Ⅰ. Fragment-level Metrics

These metrics focus on the performance of individual ions (e.g., `b4`, `y5`) across different scans and peptides. They are crucial for discovering the most stable and representative fragment ions.

| Metric Name | Meaning | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `avg_intensity` | Average matched intensity | To determine if a fragment is consistently strong. |
| `std_intensity` | Standard deviation of intensity | To assess the stability and consistency of the ion's signal. |
| `avg_delta_ppm` | Average mass error in parts-per-million | Lower error indicates higher confidence in the match. |
| `freq_in_rank1` | Frequency of appearing in rank=1 spectra | To find "core fragments" that are highly representative. |
| `appear_ratio` | Ratio of appearance in all scans for a given peptide | To determine if it is a consistently observed fragment for that peptide. |
| `ion_type` | Whether it is a b-ion or y-ion | To facilitate grouped analysis of fragmentation patterns. |

## Ⅱ. Scan-level Metrics

These metrics evaluate the overall quality and completeness of fragmentation for each individual spectrum (identified by `scan_i`).

| Metric Name | Meaning | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `n_matched_ions` | Total number of matched ions | To assess the overall quality of the spectrum match. |
| `sum_intensity` | Sum of all matched ion intensities | Represents the total signal strength of the spectrum. |
| `mean_delta_ppm` | Average mass error across all matched ions | Indicates the overall mass accuracy of the scan. |
| `b_count`, `y_count` | Number of matched b-ions and y-ions | To see which ion series dominates the spectrum. |
| `b_y_ratio` | Ratio of b-ion vs. y-ion intensity or count | To understand fragmentation preferences. |
| `top_n_intensity_share` | Intensity share of the top N most intense fragments | To determine if the spectrum is dominated by a few strong signals. |

## Ⅲ. Peptide-level Metrics

These metrics aggregate data from multiple scans to describe the overall fragmentation coverage and representative patterns for each peptide.

| Metric Name | Meaning | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `top_fragments_per_peptide` | The set of most frequently observed fragments | Can be used to build an "ideal ion template" or spectral library. |
| `ion_coverage` | Ratio of detected fragment ions to theoretical ions | To evaluate the completeness of the fragmentation observed. |
| `scan_count` | Total number of spectra matched to the peptide | Indicates the amount of data supporting the identification. |
| `frag_consistency_score` | Consistency of ions across multiple spectra for the same peptide | To assess the stability and reproducibility of fragmentation. |

## 🧠 Bonus: Visualization & Strategy

### 📊 Visualization Suggestions

- **Heatmap**: Use peptides on the x-axis, ions on the y-axis, and color intensity to represent frequency or average intensity.
- **Bar Plot**: Compare `avg_intensity` and `avg_delta_ppm` across different `ion_type` (b-ions vs. y-ions).
- **Box Plot**: Visualize the distribution and stability of metrics (like `std_intensity`) for different ion types.

### ⚙️ Potential Applications

- **Build a "Core Fragment Set"** for each peptide to filter for high-quality peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs).
- **Select Specific Fragments** (e.g., `y6^2+`) as quantitative targets for DIA (Data-Independent Acquisition) experiments.
- **Optimize Ion Selection Strategies** for building more effective spectral libraries.

## 🧬 Physicochemical Feature Analysis

> **Yes! You should concurrently analyze sequence-level physicochemical properties, including hydrophobicity.**
>
> **Why? Because they can:**
> - Explain differences in fragmentation patterns (e.g., why some sequences favor y-ions over b-ions).
> - Predict which peptides are more easily identified (*in silico* prediction scoring).
> - Serve as input features for machine learning models to improve spectrum matching or quantification accuracy.

### Recommended Physicochemical Features to Analyze

| Feature Name | Meaning | Interpretive Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hydrophobicity** | Sum or average of hydrophobicity scores of residues | Highly hydrophobic peptides elute later in LC-MS and tend to carry higher charges. |
| **Molecular Weight** | The mass of the peptide | Determines the precursor m/z distribution range. |
| **Isoelectric Point (pI)** | The pH at which the peptide has no net charge | Affects charge state distribution and fragmentation behavior. |
| **GRAVY Score** | Grand Average of Hydropathicity | Often used in protein expression analysis; also influences electrospray efficiency. |
| **Instability Index** | Prediction of sequence stability | Less stable sequences may fragment more readily or undergo neutral losses. |
| **Aliphatic Index** | Content of aliphatic side chains (A, V, I, L) | Relates to the thermal stability of the peptide. |
| **# of Acidic/Basic Residues**| Count of D, E / K, R | Directly influences the peptide's charge state and ionization behavior. |
| **Modifications Count** | Number of modifications (e.g., oxidized M) | Modifications can significantly alter fragmentation patterns and mass. |
