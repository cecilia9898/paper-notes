### Phys-chem Properties Explained

- **length**: Number of amino acids in the peptide sequence.  
- **molecular_weight_mod**: Modified molecular weight (Da), includes PTMs or tags.  
- **isoelectric_point (pI)**: pH at which the peptide carries no net charge.  
- **gravy**: Grand Average of Hydropathy; indicates hydrophobicity (positive = hydrophobic, negative = hydrophilic).  
- **instability_index**: Predicts peptide/protein stability (>40 = unstable, <40 = stable).  
- **aromaticity**: Fraction of aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp).  
- **aliphatic_index**: Weighted proportion of aliphatic residues (Ala, Val, Ile, Leu); linked to thermostability.  
- **log_charge_ratio**: Log ratio of positive to negative charges (positive = more Lys/Arg; negative = more Asp/Glu).
